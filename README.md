# Morph---Java
Image alteration to phase a single image into another using grid points. 

The code is an image morphing interface.
In this design, there will be two panels that will show a 20x20 triangle grid that have a movable point on the inner most
corner of each grid space. There will be will be two buttons to select the left and right panel, a morph button, and a preview
morph button. We will also implement a JSliders that will allow the user to adjust the grid size, brightness, animation speed,
and FPS. The Morph button will transition colors of the pixels to the final image but we have not found a solution to how
warp the images themselves. we also struggled implementing the boundaries to each point.
